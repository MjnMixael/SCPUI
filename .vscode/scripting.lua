--- Multi: Functions for scripting for and in multiplayer environments.

--- @field isServer fun(): boolean # Prints a string
--- @field addRPC fun(name: string, rpc_body: rpc_body, mode?: enumeration, recipient?: enumeration): rpc # Adds a remote procedure call. This call must run on all clients / the server where the RPC is expected to be able to execute. The given RPC name must be unique. For advanced users: It is possible have different clients / servers add different RPC methods with the same name. In this case, each client will run their registered method when a different client calls the RPC with the corresponding name. Passing nil as the execution function means that the RPC can be called from this client, but not on this client. The mode is used to determine how the data is transmitted. RPC_RELIABLE means that data is guaranteed to arrive, and to be in order. RPC_ORDERED is a faster variant that guarantees that calls from the same caller to the same functions will always be in order, but can drop. Calls to clients are expected to drop slightly more often than calls to servers in this mode. RPC_UNRELIABLE is the fastest mode, but has no guarantees about ordering of calls, and does not guarantee arrival (but will be slightly better than RPC_ORDERED). The recipient will be used as the default recipient for this RPC, but can be overridden on a per-call basis. Valid are: RPC_SERVER, RPC_CLIENTS, RPC_BOTH
