# SCPUI

The home for SCPUI core development!

## Overview

SCPUI, or **Source Code Project User Interface**, is a Lua-based interface framework designed to completely replace the original interface in the [FreespaceOpen game engine](https://github.com/scp-fs2open/fs2open.github.com). This project not only modernizes the interface with a more resource-efficient design but also introduces significant enhancements:

- **Unlimited Custom Screen States**: Unlock limitless possibilities for menu design in your space game.
- **Utility Features**: Includes simple data saving, dialog boxes, and other tools for script-driven enhancements.
- **Custom Options**: Easily hook into arbitrary Lua scripts to extend functionality and user configuration.

SCPUI provides a powerful, flexible platform to reimagine the UI in FreespaceOpen.

## Style Guide
