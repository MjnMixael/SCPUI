-----------------------------------
--This contains the keyword algorithm for colorizing text in the game based on the keywords.tbl
-----------------------------------

--[[
A "term" is either a non-empty sequence characters such that each character the
sequence is a word character or ' character, or no character in the sequence is
any of those. For example, "the Intrepid's battlegroup" contains the terms
"the", " ", "Intrepid's", " ", and "battlegroup".

Keywords are broken up into terms and arranged in a tree structure. Each node
in the tree can have a color, but doesn't need to. For example, suppose
"Admiral Po" is defined as blue, "Admiral Glaive" is defined as red, and
"Admiral" is defined as white for some reason. We'd get the following tree:

  keywords['Admiral']                (white)
  keywords['Admiral'][' ']           (no color)
  keywords['Admiral'][' ']['Po']     (blue)
  keywords['Admiral'][' ']['Glaive'] (red)

When it comes time to apply colorization, we start with a term and see if it
is a key into the keywords table. If it is, we repeatedly check the next
term and descend further into the tree. Once we find a term that isn't a
match, we stop and check if our match has a color. If not, we backtrack
until we find one that is.

For example, given the input 'Admiral Po', we'd see that 'Admiral' is a
valid key, ' ' is a valid sub-key, and 'Po' is a valid sub-sub-key, and
color it blue. Given 'Admiral Poopypants', we'd see that 'Admiral' is a
valid key and ' ' is a valid sub-key, but since 'Poopypants' isn't a valid
sub-sub-key, we stop there. However, keywords['Admiral'][' '] has no color,
so we backtrack to keywords['Admiral'], which does, and ultimately settle
on white.

There is one more caveat, which is that we only want to process keywords
which are not inside a valid HTML tag. This is supported further below.
